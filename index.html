	<div style="position: relative"> 	<p style="position: fixed; bottom: 0; width:100%; text-align: center"> <H4> Fortnite Battle Royale is arguably the most popular video game out on console and PC at this time.
		<br> Fortnite was game created by <a href= "https://www.epicgames.com/"> Epic Games. </a> The game is currently free to all consoles increasing the popularity.
		<br> The concept of the game is to eliminate other players using weapons that are picked up throughout the match. 
		<br> You begin the game on the Battle Bus and can land at many different areas scattered throughout the large map. 
		<br> When playing the game, you can choose to compete alone, in pairs, or with a team made up of up to four people. 
		<br> When you first begin the match you begin with a harvesting pick ax to collect resources such as wood, brick or steel to build defenses or to use as cover when attacked. 
		<br> To speed the match up there is a "storm" that shrinks throughout the match, if caught in the storm it quickly lowers your health. Due to this, the game naturally gravitates you towards the other players in the match. 
		<br> For success in this game you need to know when and how to build, keep yourself out of the storm and also have good skill in shootouts when running into other players. 
		<br> The game has became a quick sensation with celebrities such as the rappers Drake and Travis Scott playing and broadcasting online. 
		<br> This is a game I would recommend to everyone as it is fun to play with friends or by yourself and can quickly become addicting to take part in.
